# Wachete XLSX to ChangeDetection.io JSON Converter
## Overview
This project is a handy tool that converts Wachete XLSX files into JSON files that can be easily imported into ChangeDetection.io (Distill.io importer) for web monitoring.

## Installation
Use either yarn or npm to install the project dependencies:
#### Using npm:
    
    npm install

## Usage
To convert your Wachete XLSX file into a ChangeDetection.io JSON file, follow these simple steps:

1. Create a new folder for your project and give it a meaningful name.

2. Copy the script.js and your Wachete XLSX file into the newly created folder.

3. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder you created.

4. Install the required dependencies using one of the following commands:

    #### Using npm
    npm install

5. Once the dependencies are installed, run the conversion script using command:
node script.js

6. After running the script, a data.json file will be created in the same folder. This JSON file contains the converted data from your XLSX file.

7. You can now use the JSON data by copying the contents and pasting them into the ChangeDetection.io --> Distill.io importer.
